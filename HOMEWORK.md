# Homework

Homework isn't the best word, but it kinda fits: this file contains our recommendations on things to do with the code to make your learning more interactive.

## Run integration tests

I know, you may have already ran them after the previous session. But now the tests are different, and the content is different and you can see all the debug output we written in the zome!

### instructions

1. run `nix-shell` in the root of this repo. See Environment setup in README.md for more details
2. run `npm run test` inside your nix-shell

## Holochain Gym exercices

There's an amazing resource called [Holochain Gym](https://holochain-gym.github.io/) where you can do small exercices to strenghten your knowledge.

We have covered a lot of topics in the small bits of code that we wrote in this session, so check out these exercises to help you make sense of them separately:
- [Zome functions](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/basic/zome-functions/)
- [Creating Holochain entries](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/basic/entries/)
- [Playing with hashes](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/basic/hashes/)
- [Attaching links](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/basic/links/)
- [Getting elements](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/basic/elements/#demo)
- [Anchors](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/intermediate/anchors/)

Don't worry if that looks like a lot: we'll be using the same concepts when developing other parts of the game too, so things would start to make sense as you learn more about their usage.

## Additional homework for session 5
- In this session you saw how we use source chain queries
Read more about and try the exercise from [Source-chain](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/basic/source-chain/)
- Enums in Rust are a bit atypical, if you want to learn more about try the rustling exercise for enums: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
